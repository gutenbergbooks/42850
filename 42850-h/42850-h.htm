<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<h3>I</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hamelin Town&rsquo;s in Brunswick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By famous Hanover city;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The river Weser, deep and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Washes its wall on the southern side;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A pleasanter spot you never spied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when begins my ditty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Almost five hundred years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see the townsfolk suffer so<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From vermin, was a pity.<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>II</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Rats!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fought the dogs and killed the cats,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bit the babies in the cradles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate the cheeses out of the vats,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And licked the soup from the cooks&rsquo; own ladles,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Split open the kegs of salted sprats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made nests inside men&rsquo;s Sunday hats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even spoiled the women&rsquo;s chats<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By drowning their speaking<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With shrieking and squeaking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fifty different sharps and flats.<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>III</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the people in a body<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the Town Hall came flocking:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis clear,&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;our Mayor&rsquo;s a noddy;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as for our Corporation&mdash;shocking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dolts that can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t determine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What&rsquo;s best to rid us of our vermin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hope, because you&rsquo;re old and obese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find in the furry civic robe ease?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the remedy we&rsquo;re lacking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, sure as fate, we&rsquo;ll send you packing!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this the Mayor and Corporation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quaked with a mighty consternation.<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>IV</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An hour they sat in council;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At length the Mayor broke silence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For a guilder I&rsquo;d my ermine gown sell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wish I were a mile hence!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It&rsquo;s easy to bid one rack one&rsquo;s brain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;m sure my poor head aches again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ve scratched it so, and all in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as he said this, what should hap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the chamber-door but a gentle tap?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Bless us,&rdquo; cried the Mayor, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(With the Corporation as he sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking little though wondrous fat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a too-long-opened oyster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a plate of turtle green and glutinous)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anything like the sound of a rat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>V</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;&mdash;the Mayor cried, looking bigger:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in did come the strangest figure!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His queer long coat from heel to head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was half of yellow and half of red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he himself was tall and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lips where smiles went out and in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no guessing his kith and kin:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And nobody could enough admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall man and his quaint attire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth one: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as my great-grandsire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starting up at the Trump of Doom&rsquo;s tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>VI</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He advanced to the council-table:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, &ldquo;Please your honours,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By means of a secret charm, to draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All creatures living beneath the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That creep or swim or fly or run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After me so as you never saw!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I chiefly use my charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On creatures that do people harm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mole and toad and newt and viper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And people call me the Pied Piper.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And here they noticed round his neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scarf of red and yellow stripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the scarf&rsquo;s end hung a pipe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if impatient to be playing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this pipe, as low it dangled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his vesture so old-fangled.)<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;poor piper as I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Tartary I freed the Cham,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I eased in Asia the Nizam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as for what your brain bewilders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I can rid your town of rats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you give me a thousand guilders?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;One? fifty thousand!&rdquo;&mdash;was the exclamation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>VII</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Into the street the Piper stept,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smiling first a little smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he knew what magic slept<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his quiet pipe the while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like a musical adept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You heard as if an army muttered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the muttering grew to a grumbling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Families by tens and dozens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the Piper for their lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From street to street he piped advancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And step for step they followed dancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until they came to the river Weser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein all plunged and perished!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Save one who, stout as Julius Cæsar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swam across and lived to carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As he, the manuscript he cherished)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rat-land home his commentary:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was, &ldquo;At the first shrill notes of the pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And putting apples, wondrous ripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a cider-press&rsquo;s gripe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as if a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is breathed) called out, &lsquo;Oh, rats, rejoice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ready staved, like a great sun shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious scarce an inch before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as methought it said, &lsquo;Come, bore me!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I found the Weser rolling o&rsquo;er me.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You should have heard the Hamelin people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; cried the Mayor, &ldquo;and get long poles,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The door in the mountainside shut fast.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And could not dance the whole of the way;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And in after years, if you would blame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all I remember is&mdash;friends flocking round<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I was, am, and ever shall be&mdash;mouse, nay, mouse of all its clan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorriest sample, if you take the kitchen&rsquo;s estimate for fame;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hero! None of such heroics suit myself who read plain words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doff my hat, and leap no barrier. Scripture says, the land&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Too much bee&rsquo;s-wing floats my figure? Well, suppose a castle&rsquo;s new:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Towers&mdash;the heap he kicks now! Turrets&mdash;just the measure of his cane!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here we&rsquo;ve got peace; and aghast I&rsquo;m<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught thinking war the true pastime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there a reason in metre?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us your speech, master Peter!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who, if mortal dare say so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne&rsquo;er am at a loss with my Naso,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;joys prove cloudlets:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men are the merest Ixions&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the King whistled aloud, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Heigho&mdash;go look at our lions!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the sorrowful chances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you talk fine to King Francis.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so, to the courtyard proceeding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our company, Francis was leading,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increased by new followers tenfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he arrived at the penfold;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lords, ladies, like clouds which bedizen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sunset the western horizon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir De Lorge pressed &rsquo;mid the foremost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the dame he professed to adore most.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, what a face! One by fits eyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her, and the horrible pitside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the penfold surrounded a hollow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which led where the eye scarce dared follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shelved to the chamber secluded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Bluebeard, the great lion, brooded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King hailed his keeper, an Arab<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As glossy and black as a scarab,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade him make sport and at once stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up and out of his den the old monster.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They opened a hole in the wire-work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across it, and dropped there a firework,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled: one&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s beating redoubled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pause, while the pit&rsquo;s mouth was troubled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blackness and silence so utter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the firework&rsquo;s slow sparkling and sputter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then earth in a sudden contortion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave out to our gaze her abortion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a brute! Were I friend Clement Marot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whose experience of nature&rsquo;s but narrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whose faculties move in no small mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he versifies David the Psalmist)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should study that brute to describe you<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One&rsquo;s whole blood grew curdling and creepy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the black mane, vast and heapy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tail in the air stiff and straining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wide eyes, nor waxing nor waning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As over the barrier which bounded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His platform, and us who surrounded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barrier, they reached and they rested<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On space that might stand him in best stead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who knew, he thought, what the amazement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eruption of clatter and blaze meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if, in this minute of wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No outlet, &rsquo;mid lightning and thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay broad, and, his shackles all shivered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lion at last was delivered?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, that was the open sky o&rsquo;erhead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you saw by the flash on his forehead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the hope in those eyes wide and steady.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was leagues in the desert already,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving the flocks up the mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or catlike couched hard by the fountain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To waylay the date-gathering negress:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So guarded he entrance or egress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;How he stands!&rdquo; quoth the King: &ldquo;we may well swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(No novice, we&rsquo;ve won our spurs elsewhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so can afford the confession,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We exercise wholesome discretion<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their first would too pleasantly purloin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The visitor&rsquo;s brisket or sirloin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who&rsquo;s he would prove so foolhardy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the best man of Marignan, pardie!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sentence no sooner was uttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than over the rails a glove fluttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell close to the lion, and rested:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dame &rsquo;twas, who flung it and jested<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With life so, De Lorge had been wooing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For months past; he sat there pursuing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His suit, weighing out with nonchalance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fine speeches like gold from a balance.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sound the trumpet, no true knight&rsquo;s a tarrier!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De Lorge made one leap at the barrier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked straight to the glove,&mdash;while the lion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne&rsquo;er moved, kept his far-reaching eye on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palm-tree-edged desert-spring&rsquo;s sapphire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the musky oiled skin of the Kaffir,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picked it up, and as calmly retreated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped back where the lady was seated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And full in the face of its owner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung the glove.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&ldquo;Your heart&rsquo;s queen, you dethrone her?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lords and ladies alike turned with loathing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From such a proved wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not so, I; for I caught an expression<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her brow&rsquo;s undisturbed self-possession<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the Court&rsquo;s scoffing and merriment,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if from no pleasing experiment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rose, yet of pain not much heedful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long as the process was needful,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she had tried in a crucible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what &ldquo;speeches like gold&rdquo; were reducible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, finding the finest prove copper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt the smoke in her face was but proper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know what she had <i>not</i> to trust to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was worth all the ashes and dust too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went out &rsquo;mid hooting and laughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clement Marot stayed; I followed after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asked, as a grace, what it all meant?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she wished not the rash deed&rsquo;s recallment?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For I&rdquo;&mdash;so I spoke&mdash;&ldquo;am a poet:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She told me, &ldquo;Too long had I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the deed proved alone by the word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my love&mdash;what De Lorge would not dare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my scorn&mdash;what De Lorge could compare!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He would brave when my lip formed a breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must reckon as braved, or, of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubt his word&mdash;and moreover, perforce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such gifts as no lady could spurn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must offer my love in return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I looked on your lion, it brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the dangers at once to my thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encountered by all sorts of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he was lodged in his den,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the poor slave whose club or bare hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dug the trap, set the snare on the sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no King and no Court to applaud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By no shame, should he shrink, overawed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to capture the creature made shift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his rude boys might laugh at the gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;To the page who last leaped o&rsquo;er the fence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the pit, on no greater pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to get back the bonnet he dropped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest his pay for a week should be stopped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, wiser I judged it to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One trial what &lsquo;death for my sake&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Really meant, while the power was yet mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to wait until time should define<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a phrase not so simply as I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who took it to mean just &lsquo;to die.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blow a glove gives is but weak:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does the mark yet discolour my cheek?<br /></span>
